## Project Objectives

This project was built in order to implement the React concepts I've learned thus far, including: components, JSX, keys, props, state, and effects. The main goal was to use hooks to manage and utilize state while fetching and using data from an external API.

I additionally decided to have even more fun with side effects and add some lively animations to the cards (using JavaScript and CSS in tandem), as shown in the video above. I has quite happy with the results and learned quite a bit. See the code at `src/components/Card.jsx`.
